Assignment 4

The data set that I was previously working with was hourly and I had a lot of trouble with it. So i switched to using a new dataset that is about travel.

I also can not knit the assignment even though everything is working in the console. So I apologize if this will dock points but I tried in multiple ways to get it to knit and was not able to ask during class. So I will be submitting the rmd and no html but I will inclue a csv of my dataset as well to help grade my assignment.
